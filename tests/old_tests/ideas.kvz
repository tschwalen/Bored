~ some new ideas
~ first of is line commends starting with '~'

~~ 
    And maybe multiline comments with double '~'
~~

~ considering adding 'auto' and 'const' keywords

~ also built-in functions for declaring lists of a certain size (and later type)

auto heterogeneous_vector = hevec(4); ~ -> [Nothing, Nothing, Nothing, Nothing]
auto homogenous_vector = hovec(int, 3, 3); ~ -> <[<[0,0,0]>, <[0,0,0]>, <[0,0,0]>]>
const SURNAMES = <['Smith', 'Brown', 'Baker', 'Miller']>;

~~ Another idea I have is a sigil to explicitly denote references to global scope, no matter where the reference is made

var counter = 0;

function do_something( delta ) {
    var counter = 5;
    print($counter);
    $counter += 1;
    print($counter);
}
